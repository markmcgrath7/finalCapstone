                <h3>Headphones:</h3>
                <p>Headphones for me are essential!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motivation: Listening to music or podcasts can help you stay motivated during your workout and push through tough exercises.</li>
                    <li>Distraction: Headphones can help you tune out distractions and focus on your workout.</li>
                    <li>Customizable sound: You can adjust the volume, equalization, and playlists to suit your preferences and create a soundtrack that motivates you to exercise.</li>
                    <li>Safety: When you are in a gym or other public place, headphones can help you block out the noise and stay aware of your surroundings.</li>
                    <li>Comfort: Some headphones are designed to be worn during exercise, with features such as sweat-proof construction and secure fit to keep them in place during your workout.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Gym bag:</h3>
                <p>Gym bags are extremely helpful for the gym! They allow you to carry everything you might need. I use mine to hold my drink, keys, headphones, towel and anything else I might end up bringing. This is something you can easing carry around or place in a locker if your gym has them.</p>

                <h3>Wrist wraps:</h3>
                <p>Wrist wraps are using when performing certain exercises. They are very useful and can take the strain from you grip strength allowing you to use heavier weight to target other muscles in your body.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accessoriesGridText">
                <h3>Wrist straps:</h3>
                <p>Wrist straps have been extremely beneficial for me. I have issues with my wrist that can cause quite a lot of pain. Wrist straps help improve stability meaning there is less strain on your wrists when exercising. This has helped me avoid injury and also helped me to recover from injury!</p>

                <h3>Trainers:</h3>
                <p>Trainers are a pretty obvious choice. However, it is worth doing some research to see what style will suit your workouts best! I personally use Nike’s Metcon trainers as these are good for both weight training and cardio.</p>

        <h1>Supplements</h1>
        <div id="supplements">
            <h3>Protein powder:</h3>
            <p>Protein powder is a dietary supplement that is often taken to help support muscle growth and recovery. Some reasons why people may take protein powder include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="wordChanger">Convenience:</span> Protein powder is an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake, especially for people who are short on time or have trouble getting enough protein from whole foods.</li>
                <li><span class="wordChanger">Muscle growth and recovery:</span> Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue, and protein powder can be a useful tool for athletes and bodybuilders looking to support muscle growth and recovery.</li>
                <li><span class="wordChanger">Weight loss:</span> Protein is more satiating than carbohydrates and fats, and consuming a high-protein diet can help reduce appetite and promote weight loss.</li>
                <li><span class="wordChanger">Vegetarian or vegan:</span> Protein powder is a good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans who may find it difficult to get enough protein from plant-based sources.</li>
                <li><span class="wordChanger">Health condition:</span> Some people may have medical condition that makes it difficult for them to consume enough protein through diet alone. Protein powder can be a good solution for them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to note that while protein powder can be a useful tool for achieving specific health and fitness goals, it should not be used as a sole source of nutrition and always be used in combination with a balanced diet. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting to take any supplement - or just do as Arnold says:</p>
            <blockquote>“I make my protein drink with whiskey. People think I’m crazy, but that’s the way I am. I get stoned, I do my own thing.”</blockquote>
            <cite>Arnold Schwarzenegger</cite>
            <br>
            <h3>Pre workout:</h3>
            <p>Pre-workout supplements are typically taken before a workout to increase energy, endurance, focus, and overall performance. They contain ingredients such as caffeine, amino acids, and other substances that are intended to boost physical and mental performance during a workout. People take pre-workout supplements to help them push through a tough workout, boost endurance, increase energy, and to help them achieve their fitness goal.</p>
            <h3>Creatine:</h3>
            <p>Creatine is a dietary supplement that is often taken to help support muscle growth and increase strength and power. It is a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in certain foods such as red meat, and is also produced by the body. When taken as a supplement, creatine is stored in the muscles, which allows them to produce more energy during high-intensity exercise. This can lead to increased muscle mass, strength, and power. Some people take creatine to improve athletic performance, gain muscle, and increase strength. It can also be taken by older adults to help maintain muscle mass as they age.</p>
